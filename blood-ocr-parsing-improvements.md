# Blood OCR Parsing Improvements

## Streaming Architecture Implementation

We've successfully implemented a new streaming architecture for blood test OCR parsing to address memory leak issues and improve performance. Here's a summary of the components we've built:

### 1. StreamingBloodTestParser

The `StreamingBloodTestParser` class processes OCR text in configurable chunks to avoid memory issues:

- **Chunked Processing**: Parses OCR text in configurable chunks (default 10KB)
- **Memory Monitoring**: Tracks heap usage and prevents out-of-memory errors
- **Async Generators**: Uses modern JavaScript patterns for efficient processing
- **Reused Logic**: Leverages existing normalization and extraction techniques
- **Detailed Metadata**: Provides performance and confidence metrics
- **Resource Management**: Implements proper cleanup with `dispose()` method

### 2. TestResourceManager

A utility class to manage test resources and prevent memory leaks in tests:

- **Resource Tracking**: Centralizes management of parser instances and test data
- **Memory Monitoring**: Provides snapshots of heap usage for tests
- **Forced GC**: Supports garbage collection for more reliable tests
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Ensures all resources are properly disposed after tests
- **Parser Factory Integration**: Works with ParserFactory for easy parser creation

### 3. ParserFactory

A factory utility to create and manage different types of parsers:

- **Unified API**: Provides consistent methods for creating parsers
- **Parser Selection**: Auto-selects parser type based on content size
- **Safe Disposal**: Ensures proper resource cleanup for all parser types
- **Type Safety**: Implements a common Parser interface for both types
- **Testing Support**: Provides specialized methods for testing scenarios

## Testing Implementation

We've created comprehensive test files to validate our implementation:

1. **streamingBloodTestParser.test.ts**: Tests basic functionality, memory usage, and comparison with legacy parser
2. **parserFactory.test.ts**: Tests factory methods, parser selection, and resource management

## Next Steps

- Expand test coverage for edge cases and error conditions
- Integrate the streaming parser with the existing application
- Gradually migrate tests to use the new parser and resource manager
- Monitor memory usage in production and adjust parameters if needed
- Consider adding more advanced pattern recognition for specific lab report formats

## Performance Considerations

The streaming architecture significantly reduces memory usage by:

1. Processing text in manageable chunks
2. Releasing memory between processing steps
3. Monitoring heap usage to prevent crashes
4. Proper disposal of resources when parsers are no longer needed

This approach will allow us to handle much larger OCR documents without memory issues while maintaining parsing accuracy.
