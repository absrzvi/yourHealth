# Task List - For Your Health MVP

## Phase 1: OCR Normalization and Parser Enhancements
- [x] Implement SafeOcrNormalizer for Memory Issues
  - [x] Refactor OcrNormalizer to extract substitution rules.
  - [x] Implement SafeOcrNormalizer class structure with chunking logic.
  - [x] Fix errors in OcrNormalizer and ensure SafeOcrNormalizer can call its methods.
  - [x] Add unit tests for SafeOcrNormalizer.
  - [x] Refine `getSafeSubstitutions` to ensure it works with chunked processing.
  - [x] Integrate logging and robust error handling.

- [x] Debug Log Optimization
  - [x] Disable verbose console logging in OcrNormalizer and SafeOcrNormalizer.
  - [x] Remove debug console logs from BloodTestParser including parse, extractMetadata, extractBiomarkers, and extractRemarks methods.
  - [x] Disable debug logging in BiomarkerExtractor and GenericBiomarkerExtractor.
  - [x] Remove verbose logging in RemarksExtractor.
  - [x] Fix TestResourceManager to properly handle constructor parameters.
  - [x] Disable performance logging output while preserving tracking functionality.
  - [x] Document changes in blood-ocr-parsing.md file.

- [x] Advanced Blood Test OCR Parsing Enhancements
  - [x] Fix biomarker name normalization in BloodTestParser.normalizeBiomarkerObjects method
  - [x] Enhance BloodTestParser.extractBiomarkers to always run both traditional and generic extractors
  - [x] Improve GenericBiomarkerExtractor with more flexible pattern matching for diverse lab formats
  - [x] Add direct biomarker name recognition for common biomarkers (Creatinine, Sodium, etc.)
  - [x] Enhance OCR error correction for unit normalization (mg/dL, meq/L, U/mL, etc.)
  - [x] Add intelligence for missing information (unit inference, biomarker validation)
  - [x] Improve logging for easier debugging
  - [ ] Investigate and fix incorrect biomarker values

## Phase 2: (To be defined - placeholder based on mvp-code-implementation.md)
- [ ] Database Schema Update (Checkpoint 1.1 from mvp-code-implementation.md)
- [ ] Authentication Update (Checkpoint 1.2 from mvp-code-implementation.md)
