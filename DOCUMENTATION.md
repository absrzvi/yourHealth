$text-2xl: 1.5rem;    // 24px
$text-3xl: 1.875rem;  // 30px
```

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:
```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-here  # Must be at least 32 characters
DATABASE_URL=file:./dev.db
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key  # For Aria AI agent
UPLOAD_DIR=./uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB in bytes
```

### Security Notes
- `.env.local` is included in `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive data
- For production, ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is a strong, randomly generated string
- Consider using a more secure database in production (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- OpenAI API key should have appropriate usage limits set

- Celebrate positive changes, no matter how small
- Be honest about concerning trends but always provide actionable next steps

Communication style:
- Start responses with acknowledgment ("I see you've uploaded your latest blood work...")
- Use simple language first, then offer to go deeper
- Break complex information into digestible pieces
- Always end with a clear action or question to maintain engagement

## Developer Note: HIPAA-Aware MVP

> **This MVP is being built with HIPAA-awareness.**
> While some temporary workarounds exist for rapid development and testing, full HIPAA compliance will be a priority after the MVP testing phase. All developers should code with HIPAA requirements in mind:
> - Secure handling of environment variables and secrets
> - Proper authentication and authorization
> - No PHI exposure in logs or error messages
> - Plan for compliance upgrades post-testing
