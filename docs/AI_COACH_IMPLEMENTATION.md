# AI Coach Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the AI Coach feature, which is focused exclusively on providing a chat interface for interacting with the AI health coach. All dashboards, graphs, and biomarker statistics are handled in the separate Dashboard page.

## Architecture

### Page Structure
- **AI Coach Page (`/ai-coach`)**
  - Contains only the chat interface
  - Focused on conversation with the AI health coach
  - No dashboards or metrics displayed here
  - Clean, minimal interface for optimal chat experience

- **Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)**
  - Contains all health metrics, charts, and visualizations
  - Displays biomarker statistics and trends
  - Shows health insights and recommendations

### Component Structure
- `EnhancedChatInterface`: Main chat component with message history and input
- `ChatWidget`: Floating chat button and container (for dashboard integration)
- `ChatMessage`: Individual message component
- `VisualizationMessage`: For displaying charts/graphs in chat (when referenced)

## Current Implementation

### Completed
- Dedicated chat interface for AI Coach
- API endpoints for chat functionality
- Database schema for chat messages and sessions
- Authentication and session management
- OpenAI integration with streaming responses
- Separation of concerns: chat vs. dashboards

### In Progress
- Chat history and persistence
- Message status indicators (sending, sent, read)
- Loading states and error handling

## Next Steps

### 1. Chat Experience (Sprint 1)

- Optimize database queries for chat history
- Implement WebSocket for real-time updates

### Security
- Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Regular security audits and updates

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Track message metrics and usage patterns
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Implement error tracking and alerts
- User feedback collection

## Future Enhancements

### AI Improvements
- Fine-tune model for health-specific responses
- Implement multi-turn conversation understanding
- Add support for custom knowledge bases
- Implement sentiment analysis

### Integration
- Webhook support for third-party services
- Plugin system for extending functionality
- API documentation for external developers
- Mobile app integration
