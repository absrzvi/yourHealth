# AI Coach Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for the AI Coach feature, which is focused exclusively on providing a chat interface for interacting with the AI health coach. All dashboards, graphs, and biomarker statistics are handled in the separate Dashboard page.

## Architecture

### Page Structure
- **AI Coach Page (`/ai-coach`)**
  - Contains only the chat interface
  - Focused on conversation with the AI health coach
  - No dashboards or metrics displayed here
  - Clean, minimal interface for optimal chat experience

- **Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`)**
  - Contains all health metrics, charts, and visualizations
  - Displays biomarker statistics and trends
  - Shows health insights and recommendations

### Component Structure
- `EnhancedChatInterface`: Main chat component with message history and input
- `ChatWidget`: Floating chat button and container (for dashboard integration)
- `ChatMessage`: Individual message component
- `VisualizationMessage`: For displaying charts/graphs in chat (when referenced)

## Current Implementation

### Completed
- **Core Chat Functionality**
  - Dedicated chat interface with message streaming
  - Session-based chat history management
  - Real-time message updates and typing indicators
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Mobile-responsive design

- **Backend Services**
  - RESTful API endpoints for chat operations
  - WebSocket support for real-time updates
  - Database schema for chat messages and sessions
  - Authentication and session management
  - OpenAI integration with streaming responses

- **Architecture**
  - Clear separation of concerns (chat vs. dashboards)
  - Type-safe API contracts
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Optimized database queries with Prisma

- **Recent Improvements (June 2025)**

  - Rich text formatting in messages
  - File upload and preview functionality

- **AI Improvements**
  - Context-aware conversation history
  - Support for follow-up questions
  - Integration with health data for personalized responses
  - Multi-turn conversation support

- **Performance & Scalability**
  - Message pagination for long conversations
  - Optimized database indexing
  - Caching for frequently accessed data
  - Load testing and performance optimization
