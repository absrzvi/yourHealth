2025-05-30T18:01:58.885Z - Strategy 1: Attempting CSV parsing
2025-05-30T18:01:58.891Z - Strategy 2: Checking for Investigation-Values column format
2025-05-30T18:01:58.894Z - Checking for column-based format
2025-05-30T18:01:58.895Z - Investigation-Values column format not detected
2025-05-30T18:01:58.897Z - Strategy 3: Using anchor biomarkers approach
2025-05-30T18:01:58.900Z - Starting anchor-based biomarker detection
2025-05-30T18:01:58.902Z - No biomarkers found using anchor-based approach
2025-05-30T18:01:58.903Z - Strategy 4: Falling back to regex pattern matching
2025-05-30T18:01:58.905Z - Starting regex-based biomarker extraction
2025-05-30T18:01:58.906Z - Attempting to match 25 biomarker patterns
2025-05-30T18:01:58.915Z - No recognizable blood test data found with regex patterns
2025-05-30T18:01:58.917Z - All parsing strategies failed
